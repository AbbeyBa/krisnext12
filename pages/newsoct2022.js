        </h2>
        <p class="mt-4 text-xl sm:text-xl tracking-tight text-gray-700">This month, we got started with our fourth cohort of changemakers. These are youths from around the world, who go through a six-week training that educates them about web 3, blockchain and crypto. 

The cohort was launched on the 22nd of October, set to end early December. This cohort comprises members from the Youth Sustainable Development Network, Grassroots to Global Sustainable Development Network, Sustainable Green Development Initiative, and Eco Diversified International to mention but a few.
