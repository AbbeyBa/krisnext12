        This month, we got started with our fourth cohort of changemakers. These are youths from around the world, who go through a six-week training that educates them about web 3, blockchain and crypto. The cohort was launched on the 22nd of October, set to end early December. This cohort comprises members from the Youth Sustainable Development Network, Grassroots to Global Sustainable Development Network, Sustainable Green Development Initiative, and Eco Diversified International to mention but a few.

        A Future of Work principal consultant at ADP, with a passion for maths, Artificial Intelligence, web 3 technologies and diversity, equity, and inclusion; areas and trends necessary to the future of work. She enjoys serving underserved communities in relation to diversity, equity, and inclusion.

In the conversation we had with her, she underscored the multidimensional and nuanced nature of human beings. Highlighting there needs to be an embrace of diversity and a value of it, because of the strength and uniqueness it provides. She emphasised that conversations and solutions need to be proffered to current inequities, because emerging technology and the Covid-19 pandemic has made these loopholes more glaring, and racial and social injustice are also at its height.

        As a response to many of these disparities, Giselle created an NFT project called Nfty Collective, which ensures there is a safe and inclusive space in web 3 and metaverse for people with disabilities and various diversities. With a belief that nobody should be left behind at the pace in which technology is accelerating, she created NFT collections that show various disabilities of people that do not otherwise exist in the current web 3 and metaverse space. Such as muscular dystrophy, tetra-amelia, wheelchair users, to mention but a few. The collective can be accessed here
